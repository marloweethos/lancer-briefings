# DRIFTER RDC: Aurora // 4.5.5014u
The command deck of the Aurora was alight with activity, as Sabre Squad assembled for their briefing. Led by the renowned **SONGBIRD**, the squad was informed of their high-stakes contract on Elysium. With a track record of elite skill and unmatched coordination, they were the natural choice for this delicate mission. Elysium, a planet known for its untamed beauty and latent resources, has caught the jealous eye of others. An Apache of Harrison Armory, a titan in the galaxy's armament sphere, was reported to have made landfall on the planet months prior. Sabre Squad's task was to reconnoiter the dark side of the dunes for any signs that the armory had begun to establish an unauthorized base, a move that would have significant legal and territorial implications.

The gravity of the mission was clear: Should Harrison Armory be laying the groundwork for an illegal bankhead, the evidence gathered by Sabre Squad would serve as the linchpin for Union's response. **SONGBIRD** reviewed the mission parameters, emphasizing the need for stealth, precision, and the collection of incontrovertible evidence. For most, this type of operation on a planet with an unproven record is disaster waiting to happen, but for Sabre Squad, it's another opportunity to prove why they are considered among the best in the Drifters' ranks.


# DRIFTER RDC: NOMAD // 4.1.5014u
The Nomadâ€™s quiet orbit around Elysium was disrupted by an urgent contract request from the planet below. The normally self-sufficient world had reached out for assistance, an unusual move signaling the gravity of their situation. Elysium, seeks aid for a high-priority recovery operation that could not be ignored.

Elysium had reported a catastrophic event: cargo vessel 621, bearing vital supplies to the ELS Research Labs in Nu-Basa, was forcibly ejected from orbit by an unidentified hostile force. Its wreckage, nestled deep within a desolate sector of the desert, became a beacon for potential conflict, drawing attention from the notorious Dune Marauders. Vagrant squad has been assigned to recover the secured container E-64 from the crash site and ensure its safe delivery to Nu-Basa. This will be the perfect test to see if VAGRANT Squad will live up to expectations.
