Born on the fringes of a war-torn planet, he grew up in the shadows of towering mechs and echoing explosions. His childhood was marked by the rumble of battleships passing overhead and the constant fear of raids from rival factions.
From a young age, Jakori displayed an innate affinity for machines and a fearless spirit that bordered on recklessness. He scavenged parts from wrecked mechs, piecing them together in his makeshift workshop. Despite the dangers lurking around every corner, Jakori's hunger for knowledge and his determination to escape the confines of his world drove him forward.

As he honed his skills, Jakori caught the eye of a retired mech pilot who saw potential in the young prodigy. Taking him under his wing, the seasoned veteran trained Jakori in the art of piloting and combat tactics. Under his mentor's guidance, Jakori learned to harness his raw talent and transform it into disciplined expertise.

But life in the pilot's seat was never easy. Jakori faced countless challenges and near-death encounters as he navigated through skirmishes and battles across the galaxy. Each conflict tested his resolve and forged him into a hardened warrior, capable of facing any adversary that dared to stand in his way.

Despite his prowess in combat, Jakori harbored a deep-seated desire for something more than endless warfare. He yearned for a sense of purpose beyond the chaos of battlefields, a quest to uncover the mysteries of the universe and carve out his own destiny.

That opportunity presented itself when Jakori crossed paths with a mercenary group called The Drifters. Drawn together by a shared thirst for adventure and discovery, they embarked on a journey that would take them to the farthest reaches of known space.
