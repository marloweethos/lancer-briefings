Early Life:

Maki grew up in a stable, nurturing environment, the daughter of a pair of Union administrators stationed on a bustling Core world. Her parents, both deeply involved in the bureaucratic machinery that keeps Union running, instilled in her a strong belief in the Union's ideals of peace, order, and collective prosperity. Encouraged by her parents' dedication, Maki enlisted in the Union peacekeeper forces, eager to contribute to the stability and security of human space.

Union Service:

Maki's aptitude for technology and problem-solving quickly caught the attention of her superiors. Recognizing her potential, they offered her a place in an intensive cyber operations training program, where she discovered her natural talent for hacking. Maki excelled, mastering the arts of intrusion, data manipulation, and electronic warfare. Her skills made her an invaluable asset to the peacekeeper forces, and she was soon recruited into a special operations unit specializing in covert operations behind enemy lines.

As "Shadow," Maki undertook countless missions that leveraged her unique talents. She became adept at infiltrating secure networks, sowing confusion among enemy ranks, and gathering crucial intelligence without ever firing a shot. Her ability to move unseen, both physically and digitally, earned her the respect of her peers and the fear of her adversaries.

Leaving the Union Forces:

Despite her successes, Maki grew increasingly disillusioned with the Union's methods and the bureaucracy that seemed to stifle genuine progress. She witnessed firsthand the compromises and political maneuverings that often undermined the Union's stated goals, leading her to question the very ideals she had once held sacred. A particularly contentious operation, which resulted in unnecessary civilian casualties due to miscommunication and haste, proved to be the last straw. Disheartened and seeking a new purpose, Maki resigned from the Union forces.

Joining the Drifters:

In the aftermath of her departure, Maki found herself adrift, her identity as a Union peacekeeper stripped away. It was during this period of uncertainty that she was approached by the Drifters, a mercenary organization known for taking on causes and clients across the galaxy, often operating in the gray areas outside Union jurisdiction. Intrigued by the opportunity to use her skills without the constraints of Union oversight, Maki joined the Drifters, adopting the call sign "Shadow" once more.

Vagrant Squad:

As Shadow, Maki continues to hone her hacking and infiltration skills, now in service of the squad's missions. Her expertise in creating chaos behind enemy lines, combined with her squadmates' diverse abilities, makes Vagrant Squad a formidable force. Yet, as they undertake missions across the galaxy, the members of Vagrant Squad are also on a personal journey, seeking redemption, purpose, and perhaps a place to belong in the vastness of space.
