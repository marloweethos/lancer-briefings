"Celestial"

Name: Tony
Callsign: Celestial, a nod to his unparalleled ability to strike from the heavens, unseen and unforgiving.
Age: Early 30s
Place of Birth: Asteroid mining colony in the outer sectors
Affiliation: Drifters

Background: Growing up on an isolated asteroid mining colony, Celestial learned the hard way that survival depended not just on hard work, but also on being smarter and more resourceful than the harsh environment around him. The colony, largely forgotten by the rest of the galaxy, was a place where the rule of the strongest often prevailed. Yet, Celestial found his strength not in brute force, but in precision and patience. From a young age, he was fascinated by the colony's mining robots, which he would often tinker with, repurposing them for target practice. This unconventional hobby honed his affinity for long-range combat, marking the beginning of his journey as a sniper specialist.

Military Career: Celestial's skills caught the attention of a local rebellion during his 20s, fighting against Harrison Armory's attempts to seize control of the mining operations. It was then that Celestial first stepped into a mech, finding that his sniper skills translated well to mech combat. His contributions were pivotal in pushing back the oppressors, earning him a reputation on the battlefield. After the rebellion, the Drifters, a group of mercenaries who had been hired by Harrison Armory for the invasion, approached Celestial. Recognizing his talents, they offered him a place among them. Celestial accepted, not out of loyalty to the Drifters, but as a means to gain intel and continue his fight against Harrison Armory and similar oppressive forces. His ultimate goal was clear: to dismantle the power structures that preyed on the weak and defenseless. 

Personality: Celestial is a man of few words, choosing to let his actions speak for themselves. He possesses a deep sense of justice, driven by a desire to protect those who cannot defend themselves. Despite his quiet demeanor, Celestial is fiercely loyal to his comrades, willing to go to great lengths to ensure their safety and the success of their missions.

Celestial's journey from a miner on an asteroid colony to a celebrated pilot and tactician is a testament to his resilience, adaptability, and unwavering commitment to justice. His is a legacy defined by not just the enemies he has defeated but the lives he has influenced and the alliances he has forged in his quest for a galaxy where oppression finds no foothold.
